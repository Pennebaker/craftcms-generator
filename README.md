# The Architect for [Craft CMS](http://buildwithcraft.com/)

CraftCMS Plugin to Construct Groups, Fields, Sections, EntryTypes, Transforms, Globals, Assets, Categories, and Users & User Groups from JSON data.

## Installation
1. Move the `thearchitect` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory.
2. Go to Settings &gt; Plugins from your Craft control panel and enable the `thearchitect` plugin

Example files can be found in the `library` directory

## JSON Schema
The example / syntax schemas are located on the [Repo's Wiki](https://github.com/Pennebaker/craftcms-thearchitect/wiki)

If you're using the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/), you can download a [snippet library](https://github.com/Emkaytoo/craft-json-snippets) to help speed up your writing custom models for the plugin.

## Field Layouts using names instead of handles
If you have some field layouts that use names this functionality was dropped in version 1.0.3. Alternatively you can update your old models to use handles to fix them for newer versions.
